# The-Gate


I have designed and executed a professional project for a client who requested immediate control over their home gate via 4G & WI-FI connectivity, enabling control through a mobile application.

To achieve this, I designed and implemented the necessary Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the project.

The project was built using the Blynk platform, with the client designated as the project administrator. This allows them to add additional controllers, with the client serving as the super admin.

The device provides real-time control, ensuring that when one user opens the application, and another user simultaneously accesses it, there is an instant, seamless response when the open button is pressed.

The device was successfully installed, tested, and is fully operational, meeting the client's requirements.
